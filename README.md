# SmartHomeServer
Target of this solution is to provide a RESTful Server which allows to execute commands to control controllable devices like radio sockets, shutters or other devices.
To do so currently the rcswitch-pi library on a Raspberry Pi is used.
To define the location of that library and also to define the to be managed devices a settings.xml is expected.

## Currently supported Device Types and supported commands:
- RadioSocket
  - Toggle -> Toggles on/off of the Radio Socket
  - TurnOn -> Turns Radio Socket On
  - TurnOff -> Turns Radio Socket Off

## Settings XML Format
- All device types can be used here.
- Device name needs to be unique.
- Each device type can have its unique attributes.
- Path to settings file can be defined on Startup using following arguments: *-s &lt;settings path&gt;*. If no settings parameter is provided you will be asked to provide one during startup

```XML
<smartHomeServer>
	<settings>
		<rcSwitch-piLocation></rcSwitch-piLocation>
	</settings>
	<device>
		<deviceType>RadioSocket</deviceType>
		<name>name of radio socket for identification</name>
		<systemCode>normally a sequence of 5 binary values</systemCode>
		<deviceCode>normally a number between 1 and 5</deviceCode>
	</device>
</smartHomeServer>
```

## How to Control devices?
This can be achieved by starting the SmartHomeServer on your Raspberry Pi and call the REST service commandExecution.
The service works as following:

### POST
address: *&lt;the Raspberry Pi address&gt;*:*8080*/commandExecution

JSON body:
```JSON
{
  "controllableName": "unique name defined in settings.xml",
  "commandName": "one of the commands listed as supported command"
}
```
